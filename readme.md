# Here is the basic implementation of a decentralized exchange (dex) with AMM.

## what it does
- exchange that allows swapping ETH <-> TOKEN

- DEX charges a 1% fee on swaps

- When user adds liquidity, LP Token are given which represents their share of the pool

- LP owners can burn their LP tokens to receive back ETH and TOKEN
